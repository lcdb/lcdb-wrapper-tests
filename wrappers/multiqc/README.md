# Wrapper for MultiQC

MultiQC aggregates output from a wide range of bioinformatics tools into
a single interactive report.

## Example

```
rule multiqc
    input: expand('samples/{sample}{suffix}', sample=samples, suffix=['_fastqc.zip', '.cutadapt.log'])
    output:
        html='multiqc_report.html'
    params:
        analysis_directory='samples'
        extra="--config=multiqc_config.yaml"
    wrapper:
        "file://path/to/multiqc"
```
## Input
Technically MultiQC doesn't need any input, but in order for the rule to
trigger when appropriate you'll want to include as input all of the files
you're expecting it to find.

## Output
- html: the output HTML file

Note that the wrapper will automatically set the `--outdir` option to be the
dirname of output.html.

## Threads
Threads not supported.

## Params
`analysis_directory` is required. It points to the top-level dir in which
MultiQC should search.

`--force` is always automatically specified, to allow Snakemake to decide when
to overwrite an existing file when dependent files have been updated.

Additional parameters can be passed to MultiQC verbatim by supplying a string in
params.extra.

## Log
If snakemake.log is supplied, a log will be written there; otherwise to stdout.
